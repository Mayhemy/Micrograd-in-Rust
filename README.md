# micrograd - Andrej Karpathy's autograd implemented in rust

Implemented autograd engine, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's micrograd, in Rust that can create and train simple neural networks from scratch by creating a dynamic computational graph and automatically calculating the gradients (Note :slight formatting bugs are present, but they can be ignored ^_^).
